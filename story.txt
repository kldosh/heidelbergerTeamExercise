Heidelberger Team Story
Once upon a time there lived a man who owned the oldest baeckerei in the whole Berlin area.
He had to pick up his his girlfriend from the flughafen and she had a very early flight.
So he got in his Porshe and left his home.
On the way, he was delayed by a wettbewerbsfaehig Bratwurst eating competition.
Despite the unexpected delay caused by the competition, he persevered and continued down the Hauptstrasse.
Now he was driving his brand new BMW (the man gifted his Porsche to the pretty dirndel he saw at the hauptstrasse) which he won at that Bratwurst eating competition and he was listening to his favorite band called Rammstein.
He finally made it to Raesfeld airport just in time to collect his girlfriend.
His girlfriend had bought him Lederhoses as a gift.
She was hungry after her flight, so they went to a Ratskeller.
While at the Ratskeller, they noticed there was a Biergarten which presented a perfect opprotunity to wear the new Lederhosen.
They couldn't walk for long since the lederhose were uncomfortable so they decided to get desert and relax at a Baeckerei for a bit. 
While relaxing they started easy dropping on couple arguing in German behind them and then they began to have similar argument.
